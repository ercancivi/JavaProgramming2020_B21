Topic: Constructor

Package name: day40_Constructor



Class & Object:day40
		instances:
			instance variables
			instance methods
			this.
			this()
			toString
			Constructor

		statics:
			static variable
			static methods
			static block
			static imports


	instance vs static



rugular methods:

		Access Modidifier  specifier  returnType methodName(Parameter){

		}


Constructor: very special

			every class MUST have. if we dont create, compiler creates one (with no argument)

			only gets executed when we create the object


	declear:
		Access Modidifier   ClassName(parameter){

		}



	Object:
			new ExistingConstructor()

		A:
			new A();



task:
	Circle
		variables:
				radius, PI, diameter, area, perimeter


		add a constructor to initialize the instances

	Item:
		variables:
			name, unitPrice, quantity

		add constructor to initialize all fields of Item

		methods:
			calcCost(): returns the total cost
						hint:  total cost is = quantity * unitPrice
			toString()

	Employee
		variables:
				name, age, gender, SSN, salary

		add constructor to initialize all fields

		Methods:
			toString()

	Dog:
		variables:
				breed, size, gender, color, numberOfLegs, numberOfEyes, numberOfWings

		add constructor to initialize all fields

		methods:
			toString()

    Cat:
    	variables:
				breed, size, gender, color, numberOfLegs, numberOfEyes, numberOfWings

		add constructor to initialize all fields

		methods:
			toString()


	Phone:
		variables:
			brand, model, price, size, hasScreen,

		add a constructor to initialize the fields

		methods:
			toString

this: refers to the object instances
	this. : to call instance variables or methods
	this() :


Constructor call: this()
			1. only a constructor can call another constructor
			2. constructor can be overloaded. the only way to have more than one constructor in class
			3. constructor cannot be called by constructor name. we need this()
			4. constructor call MUST be at first step
			5. one constructor can ONLY call one constructor
			6. Constructor cannot call or contain itself



Task:
	1. class Name: Employee
			instance variables:
					name, jobTitle, ID, salary

			1st constructor: initialize the name of the employee

			2d constructor: initialize the name, jobTitle of the employee
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			3rd Constructor: initialize the name, jobTitle, ID of the employee
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			4th Constructor: initialize all the instance of the employee
								(MUST apply constructor Call)

			Instance methods:
				toString()

	2. class name: Car
			instance variables:
					brand, model, year, price, color

			1st constructor: initialize the brand of the car

			2nd constructor: initialize the brand and model of the car
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			3rd constructor: initialize the brand, model, year of the car
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			4th constructor: initialize the brand, model, year, pric of the car
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			5th Constructor: initialize all isntances of the car
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			Instance methods:
				toString()
