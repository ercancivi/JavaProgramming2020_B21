        1. create a class called Car:
                    Attributes: Brand, Model, Color, Year, Price
                    Add a constructor that can initialize the instances:
                                if the price is set to negative throw an exception with a message of: "Car price can't be negative"
                                if the the year is greater than current year or negative, throw an exception with a message of: "Invalid Year"

                    Make sure those class cannot be inherited
                    each sub class should have constructor with 4 arguments: Model, Color, Year, Price
