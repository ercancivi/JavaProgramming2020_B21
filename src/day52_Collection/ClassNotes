Topics: Collection Intro

Package name: day52_Collection

please go to Canvas -> java -> modules - > day52

		download the pdf presentation file and Collection Hierarchy image


Data Structures: work with data
				 in order to manage data effeciency, and in an organized manner

		Array (Fixed)
		Collection (dynamic)
		Map (dynamic)


Array: size is fixed
		supports both primitives & non-primitives
		can be multi-dimensional


Collection framework: consists of multiple interfaces, each interface is implemented by classes

	Collection (I): extended by List, Set, Queue

					dynamic

					does not support primitives

			List (I): has index numbers, accepts duplicated objects
					  implemented by ArrayList(C), LinkedList(C), Vector(C), Stack(C)

					  ArrayList (C): array based class. internally uses array.
					  					retrieving is faster ( get() )

					  LinkedList (C): each objects are doublly linked
					  					doublly liked ==> adding & removing are faster

					  Vector (C): is synchronized, Thread-safe
					  			synchronized version ArrayList


					  Stack (C): is synchronized, Thread-safe, LIFO

					  			pop(): LIFO, removes the last inserted object from stack
					  						and returns it



			Set (I): does not have index, does not accept duplicates
					implemented by HashSet, LinkedShashSet, TreeSet

					HashSet (C): order can be random

					LinkedhashSet (C): keeps the insertion order

					TreeSet (C): in sorted order
								does not accept null key



			Queue (I): does not have index, accepts duplicated objects, FIFO


synchronized: is used for achieving thread safety
			advantage: thread-safe
			disadvantage: slow

			one thread at a time

Process: execution/execution isntance of a program
		ex: firefix bbrowser, word document, media player, slack....

Thread: subset of a process. A sequence of execution within process

		shares all the resources of the process


	Concurrently:
		in chrome browser (process): 1500 * 3 sec = 4500 s
				tab1 (Thread1): etsy.com
				tab2 (Thread2): amazon.com
				tab3 (Thread3): ebay.com
				...


		in slack (process):
				dm1 (thread1)
				dm2 (thread2)
				dm3 (thread3)
				...


	Paralely:
		chrome browser (prcoess1)  300
				etsy.com

		firefox browser (process2) 500
				amazon.com

		safari browser (process3)  500
				ebay.com





multi-thread: two or more thread being executed within a process


multi-tasking: running multiple program concurrently







Collections (C): utility class of collection
