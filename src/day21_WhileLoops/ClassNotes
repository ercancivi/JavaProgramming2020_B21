class starts at: 10:05 am

Package name: day21_WhileLoops

Warmup tasks:
	SumOfNumbers
	1.  Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user until user enters a negative number.
			hint: you need an infinite loop

	FactorialNumber
	2.  Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number
			Ex:
				input: 5
				output: 120  ( because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120 )


Branching statements:

		break statement: exits the the loop & switch

		continue statement: skips the current iteration of the loop


Tasks:
  		//1. print odd number between 1 to 50 (MUST use continue statement)
        //2. print even number between 1 to 50  (MUST use continue statement)
        //3. print numbers between 1 to 50 that are evenly divisible by 3 (MUST use continue statement)



for(initialization; Condition; Iterator){

}


while loop: repeated if statement

	while(condition){
		statements;
	}



hints:
	4 data types that switch does not accept:  double, boolean, float, long
	case value in switch MUST match with expressions of the switch
