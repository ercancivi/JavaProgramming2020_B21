        /*  Warmup tasks:
            1. write a program that can return the longest string from two user inputs

            2. Ask user to enter a word. If the work contains starts with x, print the word without x.
                            Input:
                                xcode
                            Output:
                                code

            3.  Ask user to enter a word.
                If the first or second or both letter of the word is x, print the word without x(s).
                If x is the third letter it should be printed. If the first and second are x, both should be ignored.
                            Input:
                                xxode
                            Output:
                                ode

                            Input:
                                oxidex
                            Output:
                                oidex


            4. Ask user to enter two words. Then add them together and print.
            But if the last letter if the first word and the first letter of the last letter is the same,
            print that character once.
                            Input:
                                one
                                eight
                            Output:
                                oneight


            5. write a program that will return the domain of an email address:
                    Ex:
                        input: test@gmail.com
                        output: the domain of the email is: gmail
                        inputL: Cybertek@yahoo.com
                        output: the domain of the email is: yahoo

           6. Write a program  for CheckWords:
               Program accepts 3 words and :
              - if they are same length:      print "All words are same length"
              - if some same length and others not:    print "Not Same nor Different lengths"
              - if all different length :  print "All different length"

            7. write a method that asks user to enter a string.
                if the string is empty, print: string is empty
                if the string has more than 3 characters, print the last three characters
                if the string has less than or equal 3 characters, print the string itself

            8. ask the user to enter a word.
                if the word ends with "ly", print "really???"
                otherwise, print "never mind"
