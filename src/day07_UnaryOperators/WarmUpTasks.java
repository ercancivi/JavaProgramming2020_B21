        /*  Warm Up tasks:
    1. create a class called LeapYear, and write a program that can identify if the given is Leap Year, print true if it's leap year, otherwise print false
        Ex:
                year = 2020
            output:
                2020 is leap year: true
                year = 2021
            output:
                2021 is leap year: false
        Hint: if the number of year can be evenly divisible by 4, it's known as leap year
    2. Divisibility, write a program that can check if a number is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 5,
            Ex:
                number = 65;  ==> int
                divisibleBy2 ==> true/false
                divisibleBy3 ==> true/false
                divisibleBy5 ==> true/false
            output:
                65 is divisible by 2: false
                65 is divisible by 3: false
                65 is divisible by 5: true
                number = 80;
            output:
                80 is divisible by 2: true
                80 is divisible by 3: false
                80 is divisible by 5: true
