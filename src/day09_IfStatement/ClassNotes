        Single If statement

Package Name: day09_IfStatement

WarmUp Tasks:
	1. write a program that can check if the person is eligible to buy alcohol
        Ex:
            name = "James"
            age = 19

            output:
                James is eligible to buy alcohol?
                    false


    2. write a program that can check if the person is eligible to vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden
        Ex:
            name = "John"
            citizenShip = "USA"

            output:
                John is eligible to vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden?
                    true



>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

Logical Operators:  &&, ||, !, ONLY applicable to boolean

		&&: and logic ==> both
				citizen: "USA"
				age: 15

					citizen == "USA" &&  age >= 18;
					   true          &&   false
					   false


			   5 == 5 && 6 !=5 ;
			    true  &&  true
			    true

			    THE ONLY TIME && RETURNS TRUE IS, IF ALL CONDITION ARE TRUE
			    OTHERWISE ==> FALSE

			    true != false && false != false  ==> false

	    ||: or logic ==> either

	    		true || false ==> true

	    		true != false || false != false  ==> true

	    		THE ONLY TIME || LOGIC RETURNS FALSE IS, IF ALL CONDITIONS ARE FALSE
	    		OTHERWISE ==> TRUE


	    !: logical not ==> opposite

	    	!true ==> false
	    	!false ==> true


		number = 10;

		boolean isEven =     number % 2 == 0
		boolean isOdd = !isEven;



single if statements:

	if(boolean expression){

		codes

	}

	codes in if block only gets executed if the condition is true



task:
	1. write a program that can check if the given number is odd or even (OddEven)
		Ex:
			number = 100;

			output:
				100 is even number


			number = 101

			output:
				101 is odd number



	2. write a program that can print out the maximum number between two numbers
		Ex:
			num1 = 20;
			num2 = 30;

			output:
				30 is the maximum number

			num1 = 20;
			num2 = 20;

			output:
				both numbers are equal


	3. write a program that can print out the minimum number between two numbers

		Ex:
			num1 = 20;
			num2 = 30;

			output:
				20 is the minimum number


tomorrow morning:
	else statement



Review topics:
	unary operators: --, ++
	relational:  >=, <=, ==, !=
	logical: &&, ||, !
	single if: if() { }
