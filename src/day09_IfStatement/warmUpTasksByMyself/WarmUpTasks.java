        /*  1. write a program that can check if the person is eligible to buy alcohol
                Ex:
                    name = "James"
                    age = 19
                    output:
                        James is eligible to buy alcohol?
                            false
                    name = "Aaron"
                    age = 39
                    output:
                        Aaron is eligible to buy alcohol?
                            true

            2. write a program that can check if the person is eligible to vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden
                Ex:
                    name = "John"
                    citizenShip = "USA"
                    output:
                        John is eligible to vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden?
                            true
                    name = "Jimmy"
                    citizenShip = "Korea"
                    output:
                        Jimmy is eligible to vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden?
                            false

            3. write a program that can swipe two variables' value by using a temporary variable
                Ex:
                    a =10;
                    b= 15;
                output:
                    a is 15
                    b is 10

            4. write a program that can swipe two variables' value without using a temporary variable
                Ex:
                    a =10;
                    b= 15;
                output:
                    a is 15
                    b is 10
                    Hint: you will need to use some Arithmetical Operators
