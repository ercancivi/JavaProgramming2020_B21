Task 01: Variables_Practice
                declare the following variables:
                            num1 = 100;
                            num2 = 10000;
                            num3 = 3.5;
                            num4 = 2.5f;
                            num5 = 999999999999;
                            num6 = 850000;

                print each of the variables above on the console

Task 02: KgToPounds
     write a program that can convert the given Kg to pound and print the result
        Ex:
           if kg = 10;
            output:
                22.0462

               Hint: 1 kg = 2.2 pounds

Task 03: CalculateCircle
     write a program that can calculate the area and perimeter of the circle based on the given radius


     	Hints: Area of circle = r * r * PI
     		  Perimeter of circle = 2 * r * PI

Task 04: SalaryCalculator
	write a program that can calculate the salary after tax based on the salary and tax rate
			Ex:
				if salary = 100000
				   taxRate = 0.28

				   totalTax = salary * taxRate;
				   salary after tax = salary - totalTax
