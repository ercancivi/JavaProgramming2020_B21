Topics: Multi-Branch If
		Ternary (Not mandatory, but it's useful)

package: day11_MultiBranchIf

Warmup tasks: DaysInMonth
	1. write a program that can find the number of days in a month
	 	(Assume that Feb has 28 days)
	 		Ex:
	 			month = 2

	 			output:
	 				28 days


 				month = 9

 				output:
 					30 days

		Hints: it cannot be done with if&else statement, you will need single if statements

		28 days: 2
		30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
		31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7,8,10, 12


single if statement:

		if(condition){
			code fragments;
		}

		execution of code fragments depends on the condition


if & else: when there are only two option/possibilities, then we can use if&else

		if(condition){

			code fragment1

		} else { // otherwise

			code fragment2

		}

		code fragment1: only gets executed if condition is true
		code fragment2: only gets executed if condition is false



multi-branch if: when there are  3 options/possibilities or more


		if(condition1){

			statement1; // gets executed if condition1 is true

		}else if(condiotion2){

			statement2;  // gets executed if condition1 is false & condition2 is true

		}else{

			statement3;  // gets executed if all previous conditions are false

		}

		ONLY ONE OF THE BLOCK GETS EXECUTED

Tasks:
	DaysInWeek
	1. write program that can print out the name of the day based on the number 1 ~ 7
		 number = 1  // 1 ~ 7

		 output:
		 	Monday


	 	number = 5

	 	output:
		 	Friday

	NameOfMonth
 	2. write a program that can print out the name of the month based on the number 1 ~ 12

 		number = 1

 		output:
 			January


Ternary: short cut of if statement

	int num = 100;
	String result = "";

	if( num%2 ==0 ){
		result = "Even";
	}else{
		result = "Odd";
	}


	(Condition)?  means the if keyword
	: means else keyword

	:(Condition)?  means else if statement


	variable =  (Condition) ? body : body

	String result2 = ( num%2 ==0 )? "Even" : "Odd";


Task:
	1. write a program that can find the maximum number between two different numbers
			first solution: if & else statement
			second solution: do not use any if statement


	2. write a program that can find the minimum number between two different numbers
			first solution: if & else statement
			second solution: do not use any if statement

	MaxMin1


	3. write a program that can find the maximum number between three different numbers
			first solution: multi-branch if
			second solution: do not use any if statement


	4. write a program that can find the minimum number between three different numbers
			first solution: multi-branch if
			second solution: do not use any if statement

	MaxMin2
