	Inheritance

	Abstraction
	Polymorphism


Exception:
	checked & unchecked Exception
	try & catch
	multi-catch
	finally

	throws & throw
	custom exceptions


Exception: unexpected or unwanted events

	unchecked Exceptions (Unexpected): occures during runtime

					RunTimeException class is the parent of all Unchcked exception

					all Runtime exceptions are Uncheked Exception

	checked Exceptions (Unwanted): occures during compile time

				all exceptions that are not run time are checked exceptions


Exception Handlings:

		1. try & catch blocks: used for handling both checked and unchecked exceptions

					try{
						exception statements;
					} catch(ExceptionClass e){
						statements
					}


				multi catch block: parent exception type CAN NOT be placed before child exception type

									for unchecked exceptions


				finally block: always gets executed regardless of the exception

								 not mandatory

			ShortCut : select area first +right click then  ctrl + alt + t ===>>> try catch shortcut



	   2. throws keyword: used for handling checked exceptions
	   						 placed in method signature, indicates that method throws an exception

	   						 caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception






throw: manually throw an exception

		 throw ObjectOfExceptionClass
