Package name: day34_ArrayList

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can set the last element of the Integer arraylist to zero
			ex:
				list = [1,2,3,4,5];
				output: [1,2,3,4,0];

	2. write a program that can multiply each odd number by 2
			ex:	list = [1,2,3,4,5];
				output: [2,2,6,4,10]

	3. grades


Array Utility class: designed for Array data structures
	Arrays

	import java.util.Arrays;

	Arrays.asList(ArrayValue): returns the array value as collection type
								only for non-primitive arrays to use


Data Structure:
	Array: sized is fixed
	Collection: size is dynamic, none primitives
		ArrayList

Collections Utility: designed for Collection data structures
	Collections

	import java.util.Collections;

	methods:

		Collections.sort(ArrayList): sorts the arraylist in ascending order

		Collections.swap(ArrayList, index1, index2 ): swaps the elements at given indexes

			[1,2,3,4,5]

			set(0, 5)==> {5,2,3,4,5}

			swap ==> [5,2,3,4,1]

		Collections.replaceAll(ArrayList, Old Value, New Value): replaces the old values with new one in given arrayList

		Collections.frequency(ArrayList, Element): returns the frequency of the given element, int

			list: ['A', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'A'];

			Collections.frequency(list, 'A') ==> 4


		Collections.max(ArrayList)

		Collections.min(ArrayList)


ArrayList methods:
	Bulk Operations:
			containsAll( CollectionType ): verifys if the collection of elements are contained or not

			addAll( CollectionType ): adds multiple elements into the arraylist

			removeAll( CollectionType ): removes all matching elements from array list
						if the element we need to remove is unknown, we can not use remove all

			retainAll( CollectionType ): removes all the elements that are not matching. RemoveAllExcept


	removeIf(Predicate)

		Predicate<DataType>  name = p -> boolean Expression




	Task:
		1. write a program that find the unique names from an arraylist of string

						DO NOT USE:
								for loop, for each loop, while loop, do while loop


		2. write a program that can remove the digits and letters from an array list of characters

						DO NOT USE:
								for loop, for each loop, while loop, do while loop
