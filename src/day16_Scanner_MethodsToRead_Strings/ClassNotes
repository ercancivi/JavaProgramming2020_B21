Package name: day16_Scanner

Todays goals:
    - Scanner methods to read Strings
    - Applying Scanner more dynamically

-----------------------------------
WarmUp tasks:

        1.  write a program for a rate calculator: RateCalculator
            1. asks the user to enter a salary (double)
            2. asks the user how many hours he/she works in a week (as int)
            3. print the hourly rate of the employee

            assume that one year has 52 weeks

            hourRate = salary / (weeklyHour * 52)

-----------------------------------

Scanner:

    next():  Read one word (no space), and returns it as a String
        - If multiple words are given, then only the first word before the space is the value stored

    nextLine(): Reading multiple words (You can have spaces between the words) and nextLine will accept the 'enter' inputs

        - The issue of nextLine accepts the enter input and not allowing you to correctly store your String
        - The solution to this issue is to add an extra nextLine method, which is not stored to anything

    close(): This method will close your Scanner.
