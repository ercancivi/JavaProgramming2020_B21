                instance variables:
                        width, length, unitPrice, isPersian (boolean)

                instance methods:
                        customOrder(): sets the carpet' width, length, unitprice, & isParsian

                        calcCost(): should be able to caculate the total cost of the carpet and return it as double

            total price of carpet= (width*length)*unitprice

            if the carpet is persian  carpet that's came from Turkey, add 200$ to the totalPrice

            create a class called carpetObjects, and create an array of the carpet that contains 5 carpet objects ( make sure you set the instance variables of those objets)

            create two ArrayList of carpets:
                                        persianCarpets

                    use for each loop to print out all the persian carpets





static initializer block: runs first, and only one time

        String var1  = "Cybertek"


       static {

       }


           Static block initialize static variables regardless of the steps
          Static block run only one time because there is only one static copy
          Static variables can be called from anywhere as long as they are called from the Class

    create a class called BankOfAzerbaijan
            create arrayList of employee

            and add two objects of Employee from Humanresources class





regular import: imports everything from a class(es)

        import  PackagaName.ClassName;
        import  PackagaName.*;


static import: used for importing static variables and methods only


    import static PackagaName.ClassName.NameOfStatic;  // imports one static member
    import static PackagaName.ClassName.*;   // imports all static members
