WarmUp tasks:
    1. create a package in "JavaProgramming2020_B21" project named: day03_Variables

    2. create a subfolder named "Day03" under "Java Programming 2020"

Comments: giving notes to the codes. does not effect the actual codes

    single line comments: starts with //
                          only used for one single line


    multi line comments: used for multi line comments

                        /*

print statements:

        System.out.println(): appends new line at the end

        System.out.print(): does not append new line at the end



Escape Sequences: MUST be used in ""

    \n: Enter key, starts a new line
    \t: Tab Key, starts a paragraph space
    \\: back slash
    \': single quote
    ': single quote
    \": double quote



\"   \"


Task:
    1. create a class called AboutMySelf
            write a paragraph to tell us about your self
                Must include:
                        favorite music
                        book
                        TV series



Variable: makes the data reusable

    declare variables:
        DataType name = Data;

        DataType decides what data can be stored into variable name


primitives dataType: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

        Numerical primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double

                            double  > float > long > int > short > byte

        Integer numbers (whole number): byte, short, int, long
                                        (int is preferred)

        decimal numbers: float, double
                         (double is preferred)

        char:
            a, b, !, @, 1, 2, 3

        boolean:
            10 < 9 ===> incorrect ==> false
            10 > 9 ===> correct ==> true
                        maybe





Task:
    1. write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any rectangle that has integer number

    2. write a program that can calculate the area and perimeter of the square that has integer values
            A = side * side
            P = side * 4

            int side = 10;

            int area = side * side;
            int perimeter = side * 4;

            sout(area)
            sout(perimeter)

    3. Circle
            A = radius * radius * PI
            P = 2 * radius * PI

            double radius = 4.5;
            double PI = 3.14

            double area = radius * radius * PI;
            double perimeter = radius * 2 * PI;
