        /*  Warmup tasks:
            1. Write a program that will print out all alphabet letters

            2. Write a program that will print out all alphabet letters in backwards

            3. write a program that can calculate the sum of 5 user entered input

            4. write a program that can calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 to any given number
                    ex:
                        input: 100
                        output: 5050

                        input: 50
                        output: 1275


            5. write a program that can reverse any given string
                    ex:
                        input: abcd
                        output: dcba

                        input: Cybertek
                        output: ketrebyC


            6. write a program that can verify if the user entered String is palindrome

                    ex:
                        input: Level
                        output: Level is palindrome

                        input: java
                        output: java is not palindrome

         */
