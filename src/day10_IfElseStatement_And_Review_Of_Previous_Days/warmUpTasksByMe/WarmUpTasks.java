        /*  Task01: HTTPStatusCode
            HTTP is the protocol that governs communications between web servers and web clients (i.e. browsers).
            Part of the protocol includes a status code returned by the server to tell the browser
            the status of its most recent page request. Some of the codes and their meanings are listed below:
            status code:
                    200, OK
                    201, Created
                    202, Accepted
                    301, Moved Permanently
                    303, See Other
                    304, Not Modified
                    307, Temporary Redirect
                    400, Bad Request
                    401, Unauthorized
                    403, Forbidden
                    404, Not Found
                    410, Gone
                    500, Internal Server Error
                    503, Service Unavailable

            1. declare an int variable called StatusCode
            2. write a if statement that prints out, on a line by itself, the appropriate label from the above list based on status.
                    Example:
                            if status code = 200
                            output:
                                    ok

                            if status code = 201:
                            output:
                                    accepted
            Task02: ValidTriangle
                     A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.
                     Write a program that declares three integers as angles and check whether a triangle is valid or not.
            Task03: MaximumNumber
                     write a java program that accepts three numbers and return the maximum number
                            (assume that none of them are equal)
            Task04: MinimumNumber
                     write a java program that accepts three numbers and return the minimum number
                            (assume that none of them are equal)
