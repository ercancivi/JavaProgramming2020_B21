Topics: if else statement

Package name: day10_IfElseStatement

WarmUp tasks:

Task 01: ValidTriangle
         A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.
         Write a program that declares three integers as angles
         and check whether a triangle is valid or not.

Task 02: MaximumNumber
         write a java program that accepts three numbers and return the maximum number
                (assume that none of them are equal)

Task 03: MinimumNumber
         write a java program that accepts three numbers and return the minimum number
                (assume that none of them are equal)

if & else statement: only if there are two possibilities/conditions (NOT less Not more)

        if(condition){

                statements1;

        }else{  //otherwise

                statements2;

        }

        statements1: if the condition is true
        statements2: if condition is false



afternoon: just reviews

        Unary operators: -, +, --, ++

                --: decrement, decreases the value by 1

                ++: increment, increases it by 1

                post vs pre:
                        pre: changes the value by 1 right away
                                ++ variable
                                -- variable

                        post: first passes the current value, next changes the value by 1
                                variable ++
                                variable --


        short hand operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
                        =:
                            int a = 10;

                            a = 20;

        relational operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=    ==> boolean ==> T/F

                        10 > "10" // the data we are comparing MUST be save type
                        10 > 9
                        9 < 10


        logical operators: ||, &&, !  ==> boolean ==> T/F



        If statement:
                single if statement:

                if & else statement:


= vs ==:
        = : assigning value to variables

        ==: compares, equal
