        /*  Ask the user to enter the curve percentage for the class
            and to enter their grade to determine if the curve will allow them to get an A (>= 90). [Use double datatype]
            - In the case the given curve is more than 100 or less than 0, print Invalid curve
            - In the case the given grade is less than 0, print invalid grade
            - In the case the student was not able to get an A after the curves (grade was less than 90).
            Ask them if they did the extra credit assignments(boolean)
            If the student did the extra credit add 2 whole percentage to their grade

            Ex: 15, 80 --> 92.0 after curve. Final Grade:  92.0
            Ex: 25, 55 --> 68.75 after curve, Did you do extra credit -> false -> Final grade: 68.75
            Ex: 20, 60 --> 72.0 after curve, Did you do extra credit -> true -> Final grade: 74.0

            Hint: (curve value / 100) --> Percentage value of the curve
