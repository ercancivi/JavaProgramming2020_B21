        /*  Given a house type (String) print out the number of max occupants (int)
                Tree house: 1
                Mobile home: 2
                Apartment: 4
                Town house: 6
                Villa: 8
                Mansion: 10

            ----------------------------

            Given a letter (char) determine if the character is an uppercase letter or lowercase letter
                Ex: 'b'  --> lowercase
                    'G'  --> uppercase
                    'O'  --> uppercase

         -------------------------------

            Given 3 numbers (int) and a boolean calculate a number based on these conditions:

                - If the first number is even, multiple it by 5, but if it's odd, multiple it by 10.

                - If the last number is a multiply of 5 divide it by 5, but if the number is not divide it by 2

                - If the given boolean is true:
                    - add all the numbers together
                    - After adding the numbers if the total value is divisible by 10 evenly then print the number, otherwise print "invalid result"
                - If the given boolean is false:
                    - multiple all the numbers together
                    - After multiplying the numbers, if the number is odd, then print it, otherwise print "invalid result"

         --------------------------------

            Given a number(long) determine and print how many digits it has.

                - Condition: The number has to be between 1 and 100000, if it is not print "Invalid number"

                Ex: 124 --> 3 digits
                    13213 --> 5 digits
                    883218 --> Invalid number
                    23 --> 2 digits

          ---------------------------------

            Given a number(byte) grade level determine and print which school type someone is in.

                1-5: Elementary school
                6-8: Middle school
                9-12: High school
                13-16: College
                17-18: Grad School
                Other: Invalid grade level given

           ----------------------------------

           Warmup tasks:
        1) Given a number of people on the ship determine how many need to be crew members and how many can be passengers. Print how many of each type there should be.
            Total: 50 | 20 crew, 30 passengers
            Total: 75 | 25 crew, 50 passengers
            Total: 100 | 30 crew, 70 passengers
            Any other number of people on the ship is not valid
