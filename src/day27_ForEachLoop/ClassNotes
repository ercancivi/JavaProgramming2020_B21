Topics: For Each Loop

Package Name: day27_ForEachLoop


Task:
	UniqueIntegers
    1. write a program that can print out the unique numbers from an array of integers

	    Ex:
	        int[] arr ={1,1,2,3,3,4}

	        output:
	            2 4

    2. write a program that can print out the unique words from an array of string



3 data structures:
		1. Array
		2. Collection
		3. Map


for:

	for(int i = 0; i<= arr.length-1; i++){

	}



For Each Loop: a loop that's already iterated. started from index 0 till last index

		precondition: there MUST be a data structure in order to use for each

		order is fixed


		syntax:

			for(DataType   each : Collection of Data ){

			}


			DataType MUSt match with the Collection of data



Task:
	1. create string array, and store the names of your  class mates (10)

			print the first three characters of each name


	2. write a program that can combine two int arrays and then create the third array

			arr1 = {1,2,3,4};
			arr2 ={5,6,7};

			output:
				arr3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}


	3. String[] group1  ==> 5 names
	   String[] group2  ==> 10 names
	   String[] group3  ==> 7 names

	   String[] groups ==> 22 names



   4. frequency of characters
   			MUST apply for each loop

   			str = "aabbbaa";

   			output:
   				a4b3
