            FrequencyOfEachChars
            1. write a program that can return the frequency of characters from a String
                    Ex:
                        str = "ababaac";
                        output:
                            a3b2c1
            2. write a program that can return the maximum number from an array of integers
            3. write a program that can return the minimum number from an array of integers
            4. finding min and max from array
            5. Write a program that can return the average number from an array of integers
                    ex:
                        [1,2,3]
                        average: 2
                        [10, 15, 5, 6]
                        average: 9
